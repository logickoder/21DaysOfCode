# Day 9: Pascal’s Triangle

## Task:

- Create a function that takes an integer input. This integer represents the number of rows of the pascal’s triangle you
  are to return. Your function should return an array of arrays with each array containing the numbers on its
  corresponding row of the Pascal’s Triangle in the right order.
  NB: You can read more about Pascal’s Triangle [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)

## Example:

- 1 => Your function =>  [[1]]
- 3 => Your function => [[1], [1,1], [1,2,1]]
- 4 => Your function => [[1], [1,1], [1,2,1], [1,3,3,1]]
