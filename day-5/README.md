# Day 5: Data Wrangling

## Task:

- Write a script that takes a string of text and cleans it, removing all punctuation, converting to lowercase, and
  extracting individual words into an array. Showcase your grasp of data manipulation techniques.

## Example:

- Input: String of text with punctuation and mixed capitalization (e.g., "This is a String! With, Punctuation?")

- Output: Array of lowercase words without punctuation (e.g., ["this", "is", "a", "string", "with", "punctuation"])
