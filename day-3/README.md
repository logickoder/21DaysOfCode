# Day 3: FizzBuzz Pro Max

## Task:

- Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an array that contains arrays where each array contains
  the output that would have been spat out if the FizzBuzz function was called on the
  number.

## Example:

- [4, 10, 6] => [[1,2,Fizz,4], [1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz,7,8,Fizz,Buzz], [1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz]]
