# Day 8: Itâ€™s a Palindrome!

## Task:

- Create a function that takes an array of strings. Your function should return a corresponding array that tells us if
  the string at this index is a palindrome or not.
- A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward as it does backwards e.g madam, racecar, ada, bob etc.

## Example:

- [racecar,abcd,bab,kala,madam, carac]  => Your function =>  [true, false, true, false, true, true]
- [bad, good, evil]=> Your function => [false, false, false]
